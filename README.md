# BoomLoad
Loads all your Minecraft classes in one big boom, HAYO!!!


Hello fellow traveller of the void, I know you've asked yourself this question many, many times.

How could I -possibly- load all of my minecraft classes (or at least, give each a try! (as a treat?)) in one BiG BooM?

Well, I'm here to answer that. Behold, the BoomLoad. Simply include it in your /mods folder on your Minecraft 1.7.10 primed with the one and only FML!

Once that's done, you will need a copy of the brilliantly written https://github.com/FalsePattern/FalsePatternLib/releases FalsePatternLib!

After which, launch Minecraft, enjoy the scrolling log, and feast your eyes upon a truly lit classpath! HAYO
